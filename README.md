MilkyWars
=========

A simple arcade-style shooter I built as a side-project while studying abroad in the Netherlands. This project allowed me to hone my OOP javascript skills and exposed me to the art of graphic, sound, and gameplay design. The game is built on the Phaser engine and hosted on Github Pages.
