MilkyWars
=========

A simple arcade-style shooter I built as a side-project while studying abroad in the Netherlands. This project allowed me to hone my OOP javascript skills and exposed me to the art of graphic, sound, and gameplay design. The game is built on the Phaser engine and hosted on Github Pages.

### Gameplay: ###

Guide your rocketship through oncoming enemies, and watch out for the boss!

* Tap **SPACEBAR** or **Click Mouse** to Fire
* Collect **Powerups** that make your bullets and rocketship faster, and increase bullet damage.
* Collect **Bombs** and **Shields** that can be deployed with **F** (bombs) and **D** (shields).
